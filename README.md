# Ramaz Student Life

This is an app to help Ramaz students navigate their student life.
It tells you what classes you have when, the latest sports news, lost and found information, and more.

## Complete list of features: 
- ### Ramaz login
	You can login with your Ramaz email to get your schedule sent directly to the app!
- ### Schedule explorer
	A complete schedule built-in to your phone. It can tell you what you have now, later, or you can specify a letter and schedule (eg, Rosh Chodesh) to explore your schedule. 
- ### Lunch
	A calendar with all the lunches of the year is right on your phone, so you always know what's for lunch -- and when to use your priveleges.
- ### Sports
	See upcoming games across all of Ramaz's sports teams. After the games you can see the score and team's overal record.
- ### Newspapers
	Have instant access to all of Ramaz's student publications, including RamPage, XeVeX, Breakthrough, and more.
- ### Lost & Found
	Tired of getting notifications every second when something is lost, but still want everyone else to be notified when **you** lose something? The Lost & Found feature introduces a chat-based system that notifies only the people involved. An image-recognition based system is coming soon, so finding your lost objects will require less effort than ever.
